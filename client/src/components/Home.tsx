          history of watches Who invented the watch and why? For the emergence of the watch we have to go several
          hundred years back in time. Back to the 15th century which began the history of the watch. Explorers needed
          the time to navigate at sea. The latitude could already be accurately determined on the basis of the stars,
          but for the longitude was the local time needed. If the clock was one minute wrong, that was already a
          deviation of 28 km in the tropics. So the origin of the watch stemmed from the need for a precise navigation
          tool. The history of the watch started with the so-called quadrans, a disc which could be determined on the
          basis of protractors what time it was. The first mechanical clocks which were accurate enough worked with a
          pendulum. This clock needed to hang quietly, so it was not suitable for sea or pocket.
