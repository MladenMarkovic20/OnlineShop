# OnlineShop
## Welcome to the OnlineShop repository! 
This comprehensive e-commerce platform is designed to provide users with a seamless shopping experience, featuring a robust database, a server-side architecture built with NestJS, and an intuitive user interface powered by React.

### Scope
- Structured Database: Set up an efficient database to manage and organize product information.
- Server-side Architecture: Created a server to handle user interface requests, implementing logic to process requests, interact with the database, and generate appropriate responses.
- User Interface: Implemented features for product browsing, pagination, and searching, using React for building an intuitive front end.
### Objectives
- User Interface Development: Designed and built user interface components, including home, products, categories, about, and contact pages using React.
- Server Logic Implementation: Implemented server logic for handling request/response cycles using NestJS, incorporating middleware for logging and error management.
- Database Interaction: Built CRUD operations for the product entity, interacting with a PostgreSQL database using TypeORM for efficient data management.
- Testing: Utilized testing tools like Postman and Swagger to ensure the correctness and reliability of server API endpoints.
### Technologies Used
#### Client (Frontend) Technologies:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests.
- **MobX**: State management library for React applications.
- **React Router**: Library for handling navigation in a React application.
- **Emotion**: Library for writing styles in JavaScript applications.
- **Material-UI**: React UI framework implementing Google's Material Design.
#### Server (Backend) Technologies:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing code server-side.
- **NestJS**: Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- **PostgreSQL** (pg): Relational database management system.
- **TypeORM**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript.
- **Swagger**: Tool for documenting and testing APIs.
- **Validator**: Library for data validation.
### Challenges and Problem-Solving
- User Interface Design and React Implementation
Effectively utilized React components to create a modular and maintainable UI.

- Server-Side Logic with NestJS
Leveraged NestJS's modular structure and dependency injection for organized code. Implemented middleware for Logger and error management, utilizing decorators and services for defining routes and business logic.

- ORM Framework (TypeORM) Integration
Integrated TypeORM for efficient interaction with the PostgreSQL database, defining models, relationships, and performing CRUD operations. Followed TypeORM documentation for model and entity definitions, employed migrations for versioning the database schema, and optimized database interactions through efficient queries and caching mechanisms. Conducted thorough testing using TypeORM's testing utilities.

- API Testing with Postman and Swagger
Ensured the correctness and reliability of server API endpoints through testing tools like Postman and Swagger.
